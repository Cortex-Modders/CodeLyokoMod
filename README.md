Building
========

Requirements: JDK, Ant, and whatever you need to compile with MCP.

To build, make a clean MCP with Forge installed. Then make a new file in the git clone directory called build.properties
and put this in it.

```
mcpLocation=[LOCATION TO MCP]
```

Make sure to replace the [LOCATION TO MCP] with the location to your MCP directory. Then cd to the directory you cloned
the repository to and run "ant build".
