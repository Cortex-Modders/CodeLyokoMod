ToDo in update. (These are the stuff that we undid so we could start testing quickly.)

-Add textures to entity render classes. They should all go in there now.
-Make sure textures locations work with ResourceLocation
-Test DevCapesAPI(Library)
-Make sure sounds played thru SoundManager work correctly
